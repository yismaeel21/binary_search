def find_smallest_positive(xs):
    '''
    Assume that xs is a list of numbers sorted from LOWEST to HIGHEST.
    Find the index of the smallest positive number.
    If no such index exists, return `None`.

    HINT: 
    This is essentially the binary search algorithm from class,
    but you're always searching for 0.

    >>> find_smallest_positive([-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3])
    4
    >>> find_smallest_positive([1, 2, 3])
    0
    >>> find_smallest_positive([-3, -2, -1]) is None
    True

    left = 0

    def go(left,right)

        if 0 < xs[mid]:
            right = mid - 1
        if 0 > xs[mid]:
            left = mid +1

def count_repeats(xs,x):
    
    '''
    Assume that xs is a list of numbers sorted from HIGHEST to LOWEST,
    and that x is a number.
    Calculate the number of times that x occurs in xs.

    HINT: 
    Use the following three step procedure:
        1) use binary search to find the lowest index with a value >= x
        2) use binary search to find the lowest index with a value < x
        3) return the difference between step 1 and 2

    I highly recommend creating stand-alone functions for steps 1 and 2
    that you can test independently.

    >>> count_repeats([5, 4, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1], 3)
    7
    >>> count_repeats([1, 2, 3], 4)
    0
    '''
    if xs == []:
        return 0
    if xs[0] == x:
        return 1 + count_repeats(xs[1:],x)
    else:
        return 0 + count_repeats(xs[1:],x)


def argmin(f, lo, hi, epsilon=1e-3):
    '''
    Assumes that f is an input function that takes a float as input and returns a float with a unique global minimum,
    and that lo and hi are both floats satisfying lo < hi.
    Returns a number that is within epsilon of the value that minimizes f(x) over the interval [lo,hi]

    HINT:
    The basic algorithm is:
        1) The base case is when hi-lo < epsilon
        2) For each recursive call:
            a) select two points m1 and m2 that are between lo and hi
            b) one of the 4 points (lo,m1,m2,hi) must be the smallest;
               depending on which one is the smallest, 
               you recursively call your function on the interval [lo,m2] or [m1,hi]

    >>> argmin(lambda x: (x-5)**2, -20, 20)
    5.000040370009773
    >>> argmin(lambda x: (x-5)**2, -20, 0)
